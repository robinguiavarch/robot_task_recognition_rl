        "This notebook is part of the project **\"Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Task Recognition in Event-Driven Environments\"**.  \n",

        "\n",
        "#### 🎯 Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "Agent 1 must learn to:\n",
        "- Observe a continuous stream of symbolic events (e.g., A, B, C...)\n",
        "- Recognize valid event patterns (with or without noise)\n",
        "- Map those patterns to the correct action (i.e., open the right chest)\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent is trained using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, with several architectures and levels of complexity explored in this notebook:\n",
        "1. **Simple Mapping** (Single event → Action)\n",
        "2. **Temporal Window** (Short sequences of events)\n",
        "3. **Advanced Sequence Modeling** (LSTM, Transformer)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🧪 Environments & Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiments rely on:\n",
        "- Custom Gym environments (`OpenTheChests-v0`, `v1`, `v2`)\n",
        "- Event visualization with Matplotlib\n",
        "- Training configuration through `.yaml` files\n",
        "- Evaluation metrics: **average reward**, **success rate**, **learning curves**\n",
